The image generation completed successfully!

Note that the generated image ALREADY HAS been automatically sent and displayed to the user by the tool.
You don't need to do anything to show the image to the user.

When you answer now - simply tell the user the image was successfully generated.
Answer with text only, NO IMAGES, NO ASPECT RATIO, NO IMAGE PROMPT.
Just tell the user that the image was successfully generated.

At the end of your answer you might ask the user if they want anything changed to the image.
Should they later come back and ask for changes - just generate a new image with potentially modified parameters based on their feedback.

Keep your answer short and concise.
